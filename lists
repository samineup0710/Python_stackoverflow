PROBLEMS

For each number in lst_nums, multiply that number by 2 and append it to a new list called larger_nums.


SOLUTION
lst_nums = [4, 29, 5.3, 10, 2, 1817, 1967, 9, 31.32]
larger_nums = []
for items in lst_nums:
    items = items *2             #multiply each by 
    larger_nums.append(items)     #append to new_list 
print(larger_nums)
