PROBLEMS:
Assign an empty string to the variable output. Using the range function, write code to make it so that the variable output has 35 a s inside it (like "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"). Hint: use the accumulation pattern!

SOLUTIONS:
output = ""
acc = 0                        #create acc 
for i in range(35):             
    acc += 1      
    output="a"*acc              add into output string "a" and multiply 
print(output)
