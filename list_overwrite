PROBLEM
Challenge Now do the same as in the previous problem, but do not create a new list. Overwrite the list numbs so that each of the original numbers are increased by 5.



SOLUTION
numbs = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25] #given list.
hell = []         #create a new empty list.
for i in numbs:         #iterate over oldlist and increase items by +5.
    i = i +5
    hell.append(i)     #append to newlist.
print(hell)           
numbs = hell          # assign newlist to old.
print(numbs)           #this overwrite the old list contents.


OUTPUT
[10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
[10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
